                Ullas acts as the face of FEPSI. Therefore, when the events held by this project are successful, the whole crew gets off on the right foot. Holding outreaches which are essentially the cornerstone of this NGO has ensured that we uphold our goal which is to help those in need. As the years have passed, we have done nothing but find ways to refine the experiences we provide to those unacknowledged orphanages.

                The term “Soch” literally translates to “a thought”, which is one of the first steps to a revolution. 
                All major changes and progressions in the world start with “a thought”. All leaders become
                 great with “a thought”. SOCH is a project that lies at the heart of the club. The project
                  puts together various social engagements with notable personalities in order to 
                  speak about various political and other contemporary issues across the world.
                   SOCH prides itself on reaching out and trying to influence the general youth 
                   through vibrant thought-provoking VOYs(Voice of Youth sessions) that help to
                    introduce and engage them in real world problems and how they can be solved.

                <h1 style="font-size: 400%;" align="center" >Birthday Campaign</h1>
<p>Celebrations are always sweeter when they are shared. Being a source
   of service to the people around us is the greatest gift we could give to society
    . This year, on your birthday, be the change you want to see.
     As a birthday gift, give yourself the ability to do something great. 
     Set up a fundraiser to change somebody’s life for the better. Restore 
     their sense of pride, self-sufficiency, and independence. We all have 
     the luxury and money to spend on cakes, gifts, clothes, shoes, and a lot more
     . But remember, there are millions of people who don't have more than one pair
      of shoes or clothes, don't have a house to live in and do not possess 
      enough money to celebrate their birthday. So we, the members of FEPSI, came up 
      with the BIRTHDAY CAMPAIGN, which is an initiative to celebrate our birthdays 
      with children and celebrate our happiness with theirs. You can donate whatever
      you feel like - food, clothes, books, money to witness a smile on these 
      children's faces. We celebrate our birthday with the children, conduct a donation 
      drive, collect items such as books, clothes, pencils, crayons, money, and
       donate them to the children.</p>

So we at FEPSI  have come up with an initiative termed "Library Campaign", where we are collecting English and Tamil books for primary and secondary school students to set up an entire library in their boarding school. We request you to donate your old books so that your little contribution can become someone's bundle of joy.</p>

            <h1 style="font-size: 400%;" align="center" >Akshaya</h1>
            <p>The food donation drives held by Project Ullas allow us to do our part for the
               people around us by reducing their plight of hunger because we, at FEPSI believe
                that one of the ways to touch a person’s soul is through food.
              Akshaya is a series of food contributions initiated by Ullas. The objective of these
               food donation drives is to distribute food as a group or individually to the people who
               have very little access to proper nutrition. Sometimes we also join hands with local
                trusts and charities in order to get the maximum reach to the people in need. The 
                core belief that we as Fepsians embody is to help and contribute as much as we can,
                 wherever we are because “no one has ever become poor by giving”-Anne Frank.</p>

                 And the most important skill a leader possesses is to instill that
                  excellence into real life. The GLL curriculum covers several events
                   and experiences ranging from fun-filled activities to educational 
                   ones which help develop all the skills a leader should possess,
                    within two semesters. Each event is an enriching experience that
                     helps the participants to learn how to work in a team, improve
                      their public speaking skills, and work on their creativity. The
                       curriculum not only shapes the leaders of tomorrow but also plays
                        a huge role in creating a vibrant and inquisitive society.</p>
